# awake-calculator

It is a python script for MAC OS that shows computer usage and sleep time separately on battery. If the computer is on AC, no information will be shown. 
It also shows the battery information and its health. 


## Tested on 
- MAC OS High Sierra
- MAC OS Mojave

## Running

```
python awake.py
```

## Sample output

```
On use: 2:04:57 | On sleep: 5:11:50 | Battery (Design): 69.60 | Battery (Capacity): 71.45

Battery design is your current battery status in percentage.

Battery capacity is the battery status as it should be for a full health battery.
